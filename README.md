`üåêÔ∏èüéûÔ∏èüáπ Information about why @seanpm2001 doesn't use TikTok, and also related projects`

## Avoidance

TikTok rose to popularity during the time where I became more aware of what was really going on in the tech industry. I have been able to completely avoid going to the actual TikTok website for as long as it has existed. For reposts of TikTok content on other websites, and TikTok advertisements, I have not been as lucky. However, when I am on my laptop, I always have an adblocker, so the latter doesn't apply for most of the day.

TikTok is just another social media platform where user privacy is non-existant, where data collection is heavy, and where echo chambers form. Additionally, TikTok is based in the Peoples Republic of China.

## TikTok repositories

Repositories by me that have TikTok related information and functionality.

- [:octocat: `SNU 2D TikTok mode`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_TikTokMode/) - A replicant of TikTok functionality for the SNU web framework. 
- [:octocat: `TikTok`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/TikTok/) - The current repository
